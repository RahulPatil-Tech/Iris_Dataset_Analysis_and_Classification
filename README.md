# Data Science Project: Iris Dataset Analysis and Classification

This repository contains a data science project that focuses on exploratory data analysis (EDA) and building a classification model using the popular Iris dataset.

## Project Overview

The main objectives of this project are:

- Perform exploratory data analysis to gain insights into the Iris dataset.
- Build a classification model to predict the species of iris flowers based on their features.
- Evaluate the model's performance and generate relevant metrics.

## Dataset

The Iris dataset is a well-known dataset in the field of data science and machine learning. It consists of measurements of sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width for 150 iris flowers, divided into three species: setosa, versicolor, and virginica.

The dataset is loaded from the `seaborn` library in Python. It can also be accessed from various other sources, such as the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

## File Descriptions

- `project.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the Python code for the project.
- `README.md`: Markdown file explaining the project and its components.
